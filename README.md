## Overview

finto is a web server that emulates EC2 instance profile roles on a workstation
through STS's assume role function. It was born as an experiment in easing local
interaction with AWS services in a deeply-federated, role-based environment.
finto ships with a basic API for moving between roles, and handles credentials
caching and expiration.
